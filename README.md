## AI-Augmented Learning Notes

This repository is a collection of Markdown notes on various technical and cultural topics, curated and structured with the assistance of various Large Language Models (LLMs).

The project serves a dual purpose:

1. **Personal Knowledge Base:** A place to synthesize complex topics like Cryptography, Physics, and Music History.

2. **AI Experimentation:** An exploration of how effectively current AI models can assist in generating, explaining, and organizing technical documentation.

**⚠️ Disclaimer**

These notes are for experimental and personal use only. Being written with the help of AI models, they may contain inaccuracies, hallucinations, or imprecise statements. They should be treated as a “work in progress” and a reflection of AI's current capabilities, rather than a primary reference or peer-reviewed material.

**🛠️ Methodology**

The notes are generated through iterative prompting, cross-referencing between different models (such as Gemini, GPT, and Claude), and manual editing to ensure a coherent flow.
