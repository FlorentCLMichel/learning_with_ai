## A brief history of western classical music

### 1. Medieval Period

* **Dates:** c. 500 – 1400
* **Main Features:** This era began with **monophonic** music (a single melody line without harmony), most famously Gregorian Chant. Over centuries, it evolved into **polyphony** (multiple independent melody lines weaving together). The music was based on "modes" rather than the major/minor scales we use today.
* **Instruments:** Voice was dominant. Instruments included the lute, recorder, shawm (early oboe), and early organs.
* **Role of Music:** Primarily liturgical (religious service) to serve the Roman Catholic Church. Secular music existed (Troubadours/Trouvères in France) but was less documented.
* **Context:** The Church was the center of intellectual life. The invention of musical notation (neumes) allowed music to be preserved and complexified.
* **Famous Composers:** Hildegard von Bingen, Pérotin, Guillaume de Machaut.

### 2. Renaissance Period

* **Dates:** c. 1400 – 1600
* **Main Features:** Music became smoother and more imitative (voices copying each other). There was a greater focus on harmony and how chords progressed. Unlike the stark Medieval sounds, Renaissance music aimed for a rich, blending texture.
* **Instruments:** Viols (precursor to violins), lute, harpsichord, sackbut (early trombone).
* **Role of Music:** Influenced by **Humanism**, music moved beyond just the church into the courts. It became a social activity for the educated aristocracy.
* **Context:** The **invention of the printing press** meant sheet music could be distributed, standardizing styles across Europe. The **Protestant Reformation** demanded simpler music that congregations could sing, shifting styles in England and Germany.
* **Famous Composers:** Josquin des Prez, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, William Byrd.

### 3. Baroque Period

* **Dates:** c. 1600 – 1750
* **Main Features:** Defined by ornamentation, complexity, and strict forms. It introduced the **Basso Continuo** (a continuous bass line) and established the Major/Minor tonal system. Music was often highly mathematical and intricate (counterpoint).
* **Instruments:** The violin family replaced viols. The harpsichord was the dominant keyboard instrument.
* **Role of Music:** Used to project power and glory, both for the Church and Absolute Monarchs (like Louis XIV). Opera was invented during this time.
* **Context:** The **Scientific Revolution** influenced the desire for order, structure, and categorization in music.
* **Famous Composers:** Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Antonio Vivaldi.

### 4. Classical Period

* **Dates:** c. 1750 – 1820
* **Main Features:** A reaction against Baroque complexity. The music became lighter, clearer, and less cluttered. Emphasis was on "melody with accompaniment" (homophony) rather than weaving polyphony. Structural balance and elegance were paramount (e.g., Sonata Form).
* **Instruments:** The **Piano** replaced the harpsichord (allowing for dynamics: loud and soft). The Clarinet was introduced. The standard symphony orchestra took shape.
* **Role of Music:** The rise of the public concert. Music was no longer just for aristocrats; it began catering to the rising middle class.
* **Context:** The **Enlightenment** championed reason, logic, and clarity. The American and French Revolutions shifted focus toward the rights of the individual, influencing the move away from court-bound composers.
* **Famous Composers:** Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, Ludwig van Beethoven (who bridged the gap to Romanticism).

### 5. Romantic Period

* **Dates:** c. 1820 – 1900
* **Main Features:** Prioritized emotion, expression, and individualism over Classical structure. Harmonies became richer and more dissonant to express tension. Themes often involved nature, the supernatural, or national identity.
* **Instruments:** Orchestras grew massive. Instruments were improved for power and agility (valves on brass instruments). The piano became the iron-framed powerhouse we know today.
* **Role of Music:** The composer became viewed as a "genius" or "hero." Music was meant to transcend reality and evoke deep feelings (the Sublime).
* **Context:** The **Industrial Revolution** allowed for mass production of high-quality instruments. Rise of nationalism led composers to incorporate folk tunes from their homelands (e.g., Russia, Bohemia, Scandinavia).
* **Famous Composers:** Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Frédéric Chopin, Johannes Brahms, Richard Wagner, Hector Berlioz.

### 6. Modern / 20th Century

* **Dates:** c. 1900 – 2000
* **Main Features:** A fracturing of styles. Composers broke all the rules.
    * *Impressionism:* Focus on atmosphere and color (Debussy).
    * *Atonality:* Music with no key center (Schoenberg).
    * *Minimalism:* Repetitive patterns and gradual change (Glass).
* **Instruments:** Introduction of electronic instruments (theremin, synthesizers, tape loops) alongside traditional instruments pushed to their physical limits.
* **Role of Music:** To challenge, shock, or experiment. The gap between "art music" and "popular music" widened significantly.
* **Context:** Two World Wars and the atomic age shattered the Romantic ideal of inevitable progress. Recording technology changed how music was consumed forever.
* **Famous Composers:** Igor Stravinsky, Claude Debussy, Arnold Schoenberg, Philip Glass, Dmitri Shostakovich.

### 7. Contemporary

* **Dates:** 2000 – Present
* **Main Features:** extreme eclecticism. There is no single dominant style. Composers often blend classical orchestration with electronic elements, pop influences, or non-Western sounds. Film and video game scores are increasingly respected as major orchestral works.
* **Instruments:** Full orchestras, computers, digital audio workstations (DAW).
* **Context:** The digital revolution and streaming. Access to all previous eras of music is instant, allowing for a "post-genre" approach to composition.
* **Famous Composers:** Max Richter, John Adams, Hans Zimmer, Thomas Adès.
